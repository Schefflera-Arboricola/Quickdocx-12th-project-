# Quickdocx-12th-project-
Quickdocs helps the user to make large copies of a microsoft word document, in which you just have to change a small portion of text in each copy of the document, by providing samples, and it also enables the user to create their own samples and manage(or replicate) them. (example use: for making marksheets,certificates etc.)

Limitation : it only works for plain text(no text style or tables or pictures etc. are duplicated).

If you want to(for some weird reason) use this:
1. First install python's docx package (pip install python-docx)
2. Then put all the project files on the desktop in a folder named 'quickdocs' (basically, the address of each file should be like -  C:\User\Admin\Desktop\quickdocx\ <file_name>)
3. Then just run the sample.py file and then main.py 
(read documentation_quickdocs.pdf for more)
