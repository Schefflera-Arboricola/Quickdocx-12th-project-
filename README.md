# Quickdocx-12th-project-
Quickdocs helps the user to make large copies of a microsoft word document, in which you just have to change a small portion of text in each copy of the document, by providing samples, and it also enables the user to create their own samples and manage(or replicate) them. (example use: for making marksheets,certificates etc.)

Limitation : it only works for plain text(no text style or tables or pictures etc. are duplicated).

If you want to(for some weird reason) use this, then first install python's docx package (pip install python-docx) and then just run main.py.
